# Python Statistics Toolset
This is s small tool used (currently) with a .csv file, to download via Yahoo-stocks, stock-data (IRX, SPY, yields, returns, etc) -- summarizes them to an output text file, and produces charts (linear-regression, histograms, etc) to reflect the data, given the request stock-date


![For example, a bank-of-america chart-bundle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2192dd77-4918-45fe-95c5-a2ae478c0818)

Currently, the project makes use of a CSV file to make it work (uploaded an example, in the requested format), will update it with a working GUI next.

# How to operate?

Configure your .CSV file, with the details from your desired stock (and dates),
And run the python file
